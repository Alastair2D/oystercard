# Oystercards

This program models Oystercards which enable users to travel around London and retain information about their movements & transactions. 


## Goals

- I write code that is easy to change. Writing clear, readable, modular software is a highly respected skill among developers and highly prized for employers.    

- I can test drive my code.  Effectively tested software is more stable and allows greater transparency if and when issues arise. 

- I can build with objects.  As a programming style, OOP has a number of advantages:  Code reuse and recycling; Encapsulation - knowledge of an objects implementation is not necessary for its use + objects have the ability to hide certain parts of themselves from programmers (to prevent tampering) or users (to provide only what they require); Design benefits - OOP forces designers to go through a detailed planning phase and, as programs get larger, OO programs are easier navigate and manage; Maintenance - OO programs are easy to modify and maintain.
